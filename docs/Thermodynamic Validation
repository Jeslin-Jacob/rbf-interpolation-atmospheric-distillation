Below is a **standalone, GitHub-ready `THERMODYNAMIC_VALIDATION.md` file**.
This contains **only thermodynamic validation** — no interpolation math, no ML talk, no repetition from README.
You can paste this **as-is** into a separate `.md` file.

I’m being strict and reviewer-proof here.

# Thermodynamic Validation of RBF-Interpolated Dataset

## 1. Objective

Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation ensures numerical smoothness but does **not inherently enforce thermodynamic laws**. Therefore, all interpolated data generated in this repository were subjected to **explicit thermodynamic validation** to confirm that the populated dataset:

* Respects fundamental atmospheric distillation behavior
* Lies within **physically meaningful operating envelopes**
* Is consistent with **literature-reported ranges** and **industrial refinery practice**

This validation ensures that the interpolated dataset is suitable for downstream applications such as machine learning, optimization, and anomaly detection, without propagating non-physical operating scenarios.

---

## 2. Validation Reference Sources

Thermodynamic bounds were established using **two independent and complementary reference sources**:

### 2.1 Literature-Based Ranges

Ranges were extracted from:

* Atmospheric distillation design textbooks
* Peer-reviewed journal articles
* University course material and refinery design notes

These sources define **theoretical and design-level limits** for product yields, product properties, and column operating variables.

### 2.2 Industrial Plant Operating Envelopes

Practical operating limits were compiled from:

* Published refinery case studies
* Open industrial reports
* Consolidated operating envelopes reported in literature

These reflect **real-world constraints**, including control margins, non-idealities, and operational conservatism.

Using both sources ensures that interpolated values are **thermodynamically valid and industrially realistic**, not merely simulation-feasible.

## 3. Validated Variable Set

Thermodynamic validation was performed on all **12 interpolated variables**, representing operating conditions, product properties, and energy duties of the atmospheric distillation unit:

* Naphtha yield (vol%)
* Naphtha yield (kg/h)
* Naphtha API gravity
* Naphtha Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP)
* Reflux ratio
* Feed temperature (°C)
* Feed flow rate (kg/h)
* Feed flow rate (m³/h)
* Steam injection rate (kg/h)
* Condenser duty (GJ/h)
* Overall column heat duty (GJ/h)
* Associated column performance indicators

Each interpolated data point corresponds to a **single, physically feasible operating scenario** in this 12-dimensional thermodynamic space.

## 4. Validation Methodology

The validation was conducted **after interpolation**, not before. This is intentional and technically necessary.

### Step 1: Range Extraction

For each variable, the minimum and maximum values from the **RBF-interpolated dataset** were extracted.

### Step 2: Range Comparison

The interpolated ranges were compared against:

* Literature-reported thermodynamic limits
* Typical refinery plant operating ranges

### Step 3: Physical Consistency Screening

Interpolated points were checked to ensure:

* No violation of known atmospheric distillation behavior
* No unrealistic yield inflation or property discontinuities
* Smooth and monotonic trends where thermodynamically expected

Any data point violating physically meaningful bounds was flagged and excluded.

This **post-interpolation validation** guarantees that nonlinear interactions introduced by multivariate interpolation do not result in thermodynamically inconsistent operating states.

## 5. Treatment of Energy Duties (Clarification)

Observed differences between **RBF-interpolated condenser duty and overall heat duty** values and those reported in literature or plant data are **intentional and explainable**, not errors.

Key reasons:

* Duties were extracted directly from **steady-state ASPEN HYSYS simulations**
* Values are reported on a **per-case, normalized basis** suitable for multivariate interpolation
* Literature and plant data often include:

  * Feed preheating and furnace firing
  * Pump-around heat recovery
  * Auxiliary exchanger networks
  * Averaging over extended operating periods

Additionally, real plant data reflect:

* Fouling
* Heat losses
* Control margins
* Partial-load operation

These effects are not explicitly modeled in idealized steady-state simulations.

**Conclusion:**
Although absolute magnitudes may differ due to boundary definition and reporting conventions, the interpolated energy duties:

* Exhibit correct directional trends
* Remain within physically meaningful bounds
* Are thermodynamically consistent under consistent energy accounting assumptions

The complete thermodynamic validation comparison, including variable-wise literature ranges, plant ranges, and RBF-interpolated bounds, is provided in the following file:

## 7. Conclusion

This thermodynamic validation confirms that the RBF-interpolated dataset:

* Preserves fundamental distillation physics
* Respects both theoretical and industrial operating limits
* Avoids non-physical extrapolation artifacts
* Is suitable for engineering-grade analysis and ML model development

Without this validation, the dataset would be numerically smooth but **physically unreliable**.
With it, the data is **thermodynamically defensible**.
